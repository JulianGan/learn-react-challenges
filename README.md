# 🧠 Learn React – Challenge Solutions

Welcome! This repository contains my solutions to the **Learn React challenges** found at the end of every "Learn React" section on [React.dev](https://react.dev/learn). These hands-on coding exercises are organized by topic and are designed to build your foundational knowledge of modern React, including Hooks, state management, component composition, and more.

## 📚 What’s Inside

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific topic or subsection from the React documentation.

✅ **Topics covered include:**

- Rendering and JSX
- State and Events
- Conditional Rendering
- Lists and Keys
- Forms
- Lifting State Up
- Effects
- Context
- Refs and the DOM
- Performance
- Reusability (Custom Hooks and Components)
- And more as the documentation evolves!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JulianGan/learn-react-challenges.git
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

> Some challenges may require separate setup or a development environment like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), depending on how they’re structured.

### Run the app (if bundled)

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🤔 Why This Exists

I built this repo as a way to **solidify my understanding of React** by solving every official challenge and reflecting on different ways to approach common problems. It’s also a resource for other learners looking for reference implementations of the React.dev challenges.
